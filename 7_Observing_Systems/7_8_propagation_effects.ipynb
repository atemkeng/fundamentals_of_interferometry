    "This is the lowest layer of the neutral atmosphere and has typical scale height of 2 km. The refractivity of water vapour in this layer at radio wavelengths is of order 20x greater than in the optical/near-infrared (recall that typical \"seeing\" in the optical window is ~1 arcsec). Since water vapour is poorely mixed in this layer, there are phase fluctuations introduced due to the refractive index inhomogenities that result. The delay due to a non-unity refractive index ($n$) is $$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{c} \\int (n - 1) dy, $$ where c is the speed of light the refractive path length is the straight line path. The refractivity of moist air is described by the empirical formula $$N = 77.6\\frac{p_D}{T} + 64.8\\frac{p_V}{T} + 3.776 \\times 10^5 \\frac{p_V}{T^2}, $$ where the refractivity $N \\equiv 10^6(n-1)$, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvins, $p_D$ and $p_V$ are the partial pressures of dry air and water vapor respectively. Since the atmosphere obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (to a good approximation), it is clear that to zero-th order, the trosphere's refractive index will have some dependence on time-of-day, time-of-season, site altitude and latitude. However, water vapour is not well mixed in the atmosphere and is therefore not well correlated with ground-based meteorological parameters."
