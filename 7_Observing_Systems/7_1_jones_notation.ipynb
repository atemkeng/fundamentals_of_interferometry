    "## 7.1. Jones Notation<a id='instrum:sec:jones'></a>\n",
    "Jones notation, or ***Jones calculus***, forms the foundation of the radio interferometer measurement equation (RIME). Jones calculus is a mathematical description of the propagation of electromagnetic plane waves. The signal measured by any telescope not a perfect representation of the original astrophysical signal, but is rather contaminated by successive layers of propagation effects as the signal makes its way from the astrophysical source to an actual measurement on our instrument. Jones notation gives us a mathematical way of describing these corruptions. The business of estimating and removing the corruptions is called **calibration** and is dealt with in Chapter 8. In this section we simply introduce Jones notation and show how it can be used to describe propagation effects."
