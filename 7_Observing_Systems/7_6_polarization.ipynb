    "The antenna feed, like the primary beam, has a complex time, frequency, and direction response based on its design. The receptor converts EM waves to a current. Optimizing for parameters such as gain, bandwidth, polarization leakage, impedance matching, and the smoothness lead to different feed designs. A *$\\lambda/4$ (quarter-wavelength) dipole*, a classical design, is a simple dipole made up of two monopoles of length $\\lambda/4$ connected to a *balun*, which is an electronic device which converts an EM signal to a current. This design is very broad spatially, close to isotropic, with a peak sensitivity at $\\lambda$ with a smooth roll-off to other frequencies, but is not broadband or directive. Other feeds, such as log-periodic dipoles, Vivaldi, horns, etc. are optimized for different parameters depending on their use. Many books and lifetimes have been spent on designing antenna feeds."
